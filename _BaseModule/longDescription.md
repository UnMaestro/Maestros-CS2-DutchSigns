# Dutch Signs WE-Module for Cities: Skylines II
## EARLY ACCESS

Hello or Hallo!  
This is a **Write Everywhere module** that brings a collection of **Dutch traffic signs** into your game. 
Because of the new Dutch Creator Pack I decided to publish the mod today. 
Currently this is an **Early Access version** focusing only on **Traffic Signs**. Future updates will include **Highway Signs**, **Expressway Signs**, additional Traffic Signs and more! 

---

##  Features
- Authentic Dutch traffic signs with realistic layouts and colors
- Templates for easy import and customization
- currently ~150 images
###  Road Sign Types (currently available)
- **Traffic Signs** – Warning, prohibition, mandatory, and many more

 Planned for future updates:  
- **Highway Signs** – Blue motorway signs  
- **Expressway Signs** – Green expressway signs  
- Additional **Traffic Signs** and templates 

---

###  Traffic Signs
- Includes many standard Dutch traffic signs  
- Many signs share prefabs (e.g. triangles for warnings) → less clutter, more flexibility 

- Combined signs (Will be featured later update's)
- Customizable variables like:  
  - Distances
  - Height/width restrictions
  - Arrow directions

- Inspired by the official Dutch road sign system (Rijkswaterstaat, ANWB) and Wikipedia
- Early Access – more content will be added step by step  
- Performance impact is minimal (tested on mid-range systems)
